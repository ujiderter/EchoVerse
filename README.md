# EchoVerse
Interactive Alternative Reality Explorer

EchoVerse is an interactive web application that lets you explore "what if" scenarios from your life by generating branching timeline trees of alternative realities. Inspired by multiverse theory and choose-your-own-adventure narratives, it creates coherent storylines based on your life decisions and visualizes them as beautiful, interactive node graphs.
